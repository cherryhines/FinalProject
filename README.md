<p> Proposal: </p>
<p>"An architect has the creativity of a designer, the awareness of a sociologist, the practicality of a business person and the timing of a designer." With this philosophy, i wanted to build a page were a could show the different skills I have as a desinger into a personal page/ porfolio. Showing the work i've done since undergraduate school all the way to graduate school. I timeline of my work. 
What I will try to show primarily is a 3D visualization of the projects. How to get in them and have a Three dimentional experience. 
So I will try emphasize the portfolio in viewing the various projects in 3D
Starting with 3 projects. </p>
